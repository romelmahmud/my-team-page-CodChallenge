I loved this Challenge because it was tough for me at the first time. I can't positioned gallery element with flex box. I try many ways and spent lots of time thinking about it, but couldn't do it. Then I learn CSS grid and it was really easy. This Challenge help me to understand design better. I will improve my CSS Grid skill. My [demo site](https://my-team-page-devchallenge-romel.netlify.app/).
